            We are proud to present QueryIQ, a powerful tool that empowers developers to take control of their PostgreSQL databases. 
            Whether you are an experienced developer looking to optimize performance or a novice seeking guidance, 
            QueryIQ is here to simplify the process and enhance your development experience.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-300">
            The main goal of Query IQ is to provide a one-stop-shop for developers who seek to fine-tune their applicationâ€™s interactions with a SQL database. 
            By connecting their database, QueryIQ enables developers to gain valuable insights on their database from a holistic standpoint, 
            and to receive performance data through live query execution directly to their database.
